# An HTML, CSS and JS frontend website boilerplate
This a starter template that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to manipulate and render data from a JSON file of data.

Assets holds the data.json file. This is also a place where we can add images or other static assets.

"css" holds stylesheets. The normalize stylesheet aims to make styling consistent across browsers, and the main.css file is where we can write custom styles for our webpage. You are welcome to add more css files or any other css tools of your preference. The provided stylesheets are already imported into the index.html file. 

"js" contains a main.js file. This script is already loaded into the index.html file. A basic script is implemented that tells the browser to fetch and render JSON data when the user clicks the button.

The index.html file is the starting point. More pages can always be added.
