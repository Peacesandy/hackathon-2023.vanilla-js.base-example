# An HTML, CSS and JS frontend website boilerplate

## About 
This a starter template that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to manipulate and render data from a JSON file of data.

Assets holds the data.json file. This is also a place where we can add images or other static assets.

"css" holds stylesheets. The normalize stylesheet aims to make styling consistent across browsers, and the main.css file is where we can write custom styles for our webpage. You are welcome to add more css files or any other css tools of your preference. The provided stylesheets are already imported into the index.html file. 

"js" contains a main.js file. This script is imported into the index.html file. A basic script is implemented that tells the browser to fetch and render JSON data when the user clicks the button.

The index.html file is the starting point. More pages can always be added.


## How to Get Started with this boilerplate

#### System Requirements

No special installations should be required to run the existing code. We recommend you use a code editor such as VS Code.

You can also use in the browser editors such as CodePen and Repl.

### Downloading the repository

The easiest and fastest way to have the repo on your computer is to simply click "<>Code" button aboce and select Download as Zip.

If you are comfortable with Git, it is also possible to use the terminal.

### Running the code

The most straightforward route is to open the index.html file in your browser. We recommend Google Chrome for it's built in developer tools.

You should see something like this:

As you make changes be sure to save and refresh to see your changes.

If you'd ike to see updates as you make them, VS Code offers the extension "Live Server" which will tell the browser to rerender when you make changes to your index.html file.

### How this project uses data

The data for the challenge is stored as JSON file. In the main.js file we see the function fetching the data from the json file when we click the button. 

If you are new to JSON data or fetching you can check out the Mozilla Developer's Network documentation:

### Next Steps

This is where the fun begins! The direction you take is purely up to you. You can think of this repository as a choose-your-own-adventure.

You might focus on...

### Styling

You can start to build classes and a whole layout for your index page, or even create new pages that give more context to your hackathon project.

### Manipulating the JSON data

Right now, we aren't doing much with the JSON. It's possible to use JavaScript and the web browser's powerful APIs to further extract specific bits of data from the JSON and display them to the user.
